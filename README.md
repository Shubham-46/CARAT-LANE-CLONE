# CaratLane

CaratLane was founded in 2008, with the objective to make beautiful jewellery accessible, affordable and forever wearable. After speaking to hundreds of women across the country, we came to find that there was a common dilemma women faced - picking between expensive jewellery for special occasions, and everyday jewellery that was of inferior quality and was not keeping pace with their changing lifestyle. CaratLane was founded, to give women access to modern, fine jewellery, that was also wearable everyday.
Today CaratLane is India's largest omni-channel jeweller. CaratLane also has over 123 retail stores across 40+ Indian cities.
